⚠️ Improvements to be done:-
- Input validation. and present an error alert to the user.
- Navigation best practices is a stil work in progress for me, But I beleieve there is a room for improvement there
- Add unit tests to all ViewModels and Services for the sake of this THA I just added very little unit tests
- Would love to add UI Tests as they are my favorite but that would require some more time and effort
- Use localised strings.
- Support dark mode.
